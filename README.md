# Spell checker made in C language, taught by professor Eanes Torres, regarding the introduction to C language.

# Description

Implement a C language program to perform spell checking on texts written in Portuguese. The program must be able to obtain the input text via typing in the terminal or via loading a txt file. To perform the spelling check, the program must load a txt file containing words from the Portuguese language to compare with the words in the text that you want to check for correction. Each word detected with supposedly incorrect spelling is presented to the user and the program must suggest up to 3 possible words for substitution. If the user does not accept the substitution suggestions, there may be the possibility of leaving the word as it is already written in the text. The text to be corrected does not need to be large, it can be up to a maximum of 280 characters.
